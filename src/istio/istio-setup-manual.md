# Istio Setup Manual

## Pull the Containers in all the nodes

If you have rate limiting issues, then ensure all necessary images are already downloaded on to the master and worker nodes.

This guide lets you quickly evaluate Istio. If you are already familiar with Istio or interested in installing other configuration profiles or advanced [deployment models](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/deployment-models/), refer to our [which Istio installation method should I use?](https://istio.io/latest/about/faq/#install-method-selection) FAQ page.

These steps require you to have a cluster running a [supported version](https://istio.io/latest/docs/releases/supported-releases#support-status-of-istio-releases) of Kubernetes (1.20, 1.21, 1.22, 1.23). You can use any supported platform, for example [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) or others specified by the [platform-specific setup instructions](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/platform-setup/).

### Download Istio <a href="#download" id="download"></a>

Step1: Go to the [Istio release](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.13.3) page to download the installation file for your OS, or download and extract the latest release automatically (Linux or macOS):

```
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
```

The command above downloads the latest release (numerically) of Istio

Step2: Add the `istioctl` client to your path (Linux or macOS):

```
sudo cp istio-1.13.3/bin/istioctl /usr/bin/
```

```
istioctl version
```

if you do the above steps correctly, it will print the output.

Step 3: Move to the Istio package directory. For example, if the package is `istio-1.13.3`:

Try to run this command using Git Bash

```bash
cd istio-1.13.3
```

The installation directory contains:

* Sample applications in `samples/`
* The [`istioctl`](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/commands/istioctl) client binary in the `bin/` directory.

### Install Istio <a href="#install" id="install"></a>

Step 1: For this installation, we use the `minimal`[configuration profile](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/config-profiles/). Itâ€™s selected to have a good set of defaults for testing, but there are other profiles for production or performance testing.

```bash
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
```

Step 2: Add a namespace label to instruct Istio to automatically inject Envoy sidecar proxies when you deploy your application later:

```bash
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```
